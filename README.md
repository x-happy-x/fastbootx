# Fastbootx & Switch-OS Magisk Module

## Overview
This Magisk module provides utilities for efficient management of Android boot partitions directly on the device (without a PC, but root rights are required). It includes the `fastbootx` script (the suffix -x is because there was another [fastboot](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/adb-ndk) module) for flashing partitions and more, as well as the `switch-os` script for quickly switching between different OS images (simply quick flashing of .img files stored at /data/adb/boot/[partition] osname.img by the specified osname). The module has added `bootctl` for managing active Android slots.

It's important to note that there may be errors that I'm not yet aware of. Some parts of this module, including manuals and this README file, were generated by a neural network. Please be careful when using these functions.

***Proceed at your own risk. I am not responsible for any adverse outcomes.***
